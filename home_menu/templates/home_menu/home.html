                This web application first of all allows you to store and access ERP data from experiments run at the
                Faculty of
                Physics of the University of Warsaw. The data must have a specific EEGLAB format.
            </p>
            <p>
                The user can firstly upload the data to the server where it is stored. Secondly, it is possible to
                download
                the
                raw
                data files. However, the main functionality of this application is preprocessing of EEG signals.
            </p>
            <p>
                EEG Builder provides an extensive interface for the configuration of the settings according to which the
                experiment data
                will been preprocessing. In order to obtain a pickle file for downloading and further analysis at the
                end.

        So far, the Department of Biomedical Physics has managed to collect data from 12 experiments involving 36
        subjects who responded to 800 stimuli of displaying words on a computer screen. The studies were conducted in
        three different variants:
        <ul>


            <li>Lexical decision tasks (LTD)</li>
            <li>Emotional decision task (ETD)</li>
            <li>Stroop test</li>
        </ul>

        Words are assigned features, for example[1]:
        <ul>
            <li>valence (positive/negative)</li>
            <li>origin of the emotion ("from the heart"/"from the mind")</li>
            <li>meaning (personal/subjective)</li>
            <li>arousal</li>
            <li>pseudo-words</li>
        </ul>
